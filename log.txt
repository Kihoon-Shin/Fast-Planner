In my environment 
I gonna simulate the px4 at gazebo and the simulation packages, which HKUST-Aerial-Robotics made, makes build error, 
so I deleted the packages without /Fast-Planner/uav_simulator/Utils/waypoint_generator

And I worked at the /Fast-Planner/fast_planner/plan_manage/launch
Not to edit the original launch files, I added copies, which names like 'px4_~~~', and edited for my drone

So 'px4_~~~' launch files are to run the fast planner at the PX4 drone with D435 and T265

- for simulation in gazebo : I followed this https://discuss.px4.io/t/create-custom-model-for-sitl/6700/4
(1) change if you want ~~/PX4-Autopilot/Tools/sitl_gazebo/models/depth_camera
(2) add ~~/PX4-Autopilot/ROMFS/px4fmu_common/init.d-posix/airframes/1024_iris_depth_camera
    '1024_iris_depth_camera' file is in sorage folder and it is just to get the depth topic from sitl_px4
(3) add '1024_iris_depth_camera'at ~~/PX4-Autopilot/ROMFS/px4fmu_common/init.d-posix/airframes/CMakeLists.txt
(4) add 'iris_depth_camera' at ~~/PX4-Autopilot/pltforms/posix/cmake/sitl_target.cmake at 'set(models '
(5)
