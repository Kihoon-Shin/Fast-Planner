# Fast-Planner for Real Quadrotor with px4

The orignal fast planner is https://github.com/HKUST-Aerial-Robotics/Fast-Planner   
in may case the main algorithm and concept is same but edited for px4 sitl and real flight

**px4**   
My drone use px4 with D435i, T265   
I added and edited some parts to run in px4 and check it in px4_sitl gazebo

now kino planner is working but topo is not perfect
